TO DO:

Goals
-----

Take Messi and move it to the next level.  The original author is unresponsive.

If you are interested in helping, send me Pull Requests and I'll
review them.  Where appropriate, I'll try to add the Pull Requests
that have been already issued for the official Messi repo.

* [x] In the current build, the messi.min.js works but the messi.js is broken.
* [x] A guplfile.js needs to be created to manage testing and minifying.
* [ ] Tests—preferably in Mocha—need to be written.
* [ ] Messi does not play nice with other Javascript.  It needs to be wrapped in an IIFE so it's no longer in the
  global scope. See PR27 & PR28.
